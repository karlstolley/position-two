			<h2>Position and Images</h2>
			<ul class="reminders">
				<li>
					<h3>It’s All Illusion</h3>
					<p>
						CSS positioning coupled with background images leads to
						compelling page designs. Just remember, though: it’s all
						an illusion, a matter of hiding some things, revealing
						others, and sliding it all into place.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>One Image Per Element</h3>
					<p>
						Until some of the specifications of CSS3 for
						<a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/">border-image</a>
						become more stable, we can only reliably design with
						one background image per element. Use them wisely—and
						pay attention to sibling and parent elements, and how
						they might aid the design of their siblings or children.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Break Out of the Box</h3>
					<p>
						All elements appear as boxes; but your images need not.
						The key to breaking the boxy look that the box model 
						encourages is to use images that violate the lines of
						boxes, applying extra padding where necessary.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Expect Expanding Content</h3>
					<p>
						Although it is tempting to make complete images, with
						tops, bottoms, and sides, content expands and contracts.
						Seek out repeating images where this may occur, and make
						use of sibling and parent images to add top and bottom
						images.
					</p>
